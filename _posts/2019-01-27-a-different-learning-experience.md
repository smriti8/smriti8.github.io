Well, this is about my work-from-home internship at Savera.ai that was an altogether different experience. I got to learn a lot while working on the project, not just about AI/ML driven solutions but also community working, planning and collaborating, and reaching out to people.

The journey begins after I post-graduated from IIT Guwahati and was looking for some working experience in Computer vision realted projects. That's when I got to know about an internship at Savera.ai that is invloved in automatization of solar panel installation.
